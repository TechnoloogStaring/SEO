After carefully analyzing green directories and content sites, as well as assessing your competitors' strategies, I can present the following list of outreach targets for link building and guest post ideas:

1. Sustainable Fashion Blogs: We could collaborate with these blogs for posts about the cashback offers on our sustainable fashion items. Example blogs include 'Sustainably Chic', 'The Green Hub', and 'Eco Warrior Princess'.

2. Eco-friendly Home Decor Blogs: We could offer guest posts on upcycled furniture with a money-back guarantee. Blogs like 'Upcycle That', 'Recyclart' and 'Upcycled World' could be worthwhile targets.

3. Green Home Appliances Blogs: Blogs like 'Treehugger' and 'The Eco Guide' often talk about eco-friendly appliances and we could collaborate for articles about our flexible cashback policy.

4. Upcycled Furniture Blogs: 'Upcyclist', 'The Upcycling Emporium' and 'My Upcycled Life' are examples of blogs where we could offer guest posts on cashback offers for upcycled wood furniture.

5. Ethical Fashion Blogs: Collaborate with blogs such as 'Good On You' and 'The Ethical Fashion Guide' for posts about cashback deals on recycled material fashion items.

6. Organic Clothing Blogs: Blogs like 'Organic Authority' and 'Organic Lifestyle Magazine' can be approached for guest posts on our cashback offers on organic fabric clothing.

7. Eco-friendly Appliance Blogs: We could offer posts on eco-friendly refrigerators with a cashback offer to blogs like 'EcoHome' or 'The Green Product Award'.

8. Sustainable accessories Blogs: Collaborate with 'EcoCult' or 'The Peahen' for posts about sustainable leather bags with cashback.

9. Recycled Furniture Blogs: Blogs like 'RecycleNation' and 'I Recyclart' can be targets for posts regarding recycled glass furniture with a cashback deal.

10. Green Home Appliances Directories: Directories such as 'The Eco Market' or 'Green Directory' can be approached for collaboration on green home appliances with cashback.
